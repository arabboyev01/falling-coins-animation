# Falling Coins Animation

This project is an interactive screen where, upon tapping, coins begin to fall from the top of the screen, gradually filling up the screen. The animation stops adding new coins once a certain fill level is reached.

## Requirements
- The animation stops adding coins when the screen is 70% filled with coins.
- Additional taps after reaching the fill level do not cause more coins to fall.
- Optimized for mobile platforms.
